# Recoil
Powerful react powered front-end framework.

This is my fist open release, documentation will be coming soon.

Currently I remember using the following dependencies. So big thanks to the following packages:

- Animate.css
- Normalize.css
- classNames npm package

========================

Run npm install, then run npm start.
