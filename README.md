# Recoil

NOT PRODUCTION READY***

Powerful front-end boilerplate react components.

This is my fist open release, documentation will be coming soon.

Currently I remember using the following dependencies. So big thanks to the following packages:

- Animate.css
- Normalize.css
- classNames npm package

========================

Run npm install, then run npm start.

========================

The following components need to be fleshed out/started :

- Grid
- Table
- Panel
- Wizard

========================

Thanks to Bootstrap, Semantics UI, Kendo UI, Material UI and finally IOS design principles.
